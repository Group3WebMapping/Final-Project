FINAL PROJECT OUTLINE


• Your project should have a clear objective of designing a customized web mapping
application (consistent with your proposal).

• Your application should be written in a combination of HTML/CSS/JavaScript
(each in a separate file) and uses ArcGIS JavaScript API, Leaflet, and/or other web
mapping techniques (e.g. turf.js).

• Your application should be flexible/extendable enough to be reused by other
researchers (e.g., always use relative paths).

• The webpage should include at least a header div (displaying basic information
such as the title), a main div displaying maps and other essential components of
your application, a top and/or side navigation bar, and a footer div (showing
copyright information, group name, date, etc.)

• You can choose your own topic/data to display. However, your application should
include at least the following components and functionalities:

1. Display a base map (tiled layer) with basic navigation tools/functions: Zoom-
in, Zoom-out, Pan, etc.

2. Symbolize and display external feature layers either from a local repository
or a remote server with real-world sample data (e.g., displaying .shp or GeoJSON
hurricane data in a disaster-related mapping application)

3. Display appropriate markers and symbols

4. Support event-driven functions such as pop-ups/info windows

5. Geocoding, direction, search, OR query functions (Your application needs to
support at least one of these functions)

6. Add explanatory texts, images, and videos as you see fit

7. Add at least one spatial analysis component (e.g., heatmap, clustering,
measurements, buffering, etc.)

8. Besides the index page, add at least one “about.html” page with the group
members’ photos and academic background (linked to the index.html page). Add
other supplementary html pages/links if needed (e.g., a resources.html page
illustrating related references/resources used in your application).

• Style your webpages properly. Your pages should follow the basic aesthetic
guidelines and design principles (recall the lectures about colors and typography in
Geo 3411; for example, strong complementary colors should not be combined (e.g.,
bright red and bright green).

• Your application should be user friendly and allow user input, e.g., via textboxes,
dropdown menus, and/or other types of user interface control etc.

• The grading of the project considers the complexity of the application. You are
encouraged to explore more advanced functionalities of web mapping APIs, so you
can receive more credits for the “complexity” category in the grading matrix.

• You need to comment on each code block of your script. Your comments should
be sufficiently clear for another developer to understand and reuse your code.

• Note: You are allowed to use external data and resources; however, the topic and
functionalities of your application should be created or customized to reflect your
original work.

• Please submit the following files for your final project:
1. Please create a GitHub repository for the final project and add your TA and
instructor as collaborators. Please organize your repository as follows:

• Your webpage HTML file (.html) – in the root folder
• The associated CSS file (.css) (remember to always use “relative path) – in
a “css” folder
• The associated JavaScript(s) (.js) (remember to always use “relative path”)
– in a “js” folder
• Sample data (if applicable) (e.g., tables, feature classes, raster datasets, etc.)
– in a “data” folder
• Resources such as images, videos, charts or other files required by your
website. – in a “resources” folder

• A readme.md file briefly introduce the function of your application. This can
be a 100~200-word abstract of your final report with a screenshot of your
website. – in the root folder

2. Your final report explaining the usage of the application (.docx, no PDF!!) and
the final presentation slides. Please include a link to your GitHub repository
and a link to your GitHub project website (note: those are different links) on
the first page of the report – upload to Canvas – one submission per group.

3. Please download your GitHub repository as a zip file and upload it to Canvas.
This is for backup purposes. In case something goes wrong with GitHub, we
can still grade your project – one submission per group.
Note: The idea of open source is to make information available while keeping the
ownership of your original work. GitHub makes every step of the development very
transparent, which ensures that we know who contributed what information at what time.
If you only want to share the details during development with your collaborators, you can
make your repository private, but make sure to add your TA and instructor as
collaborators so we can view the repository
