Abstract

This project presents an interactive web map visualizing population changes and demographic data in Hays County, Texas, from 2010 to 2020. The motivation for this project stemmed from the need to make spatial demographic data more accessible and understandable for local planners, researchers, and the general public. Population shifts, income levels, housing occupancy, and median age are critical indicators for policy-making, urban planning, and community development. A web map was selected as the appropriate tool due to its ability to combine geographic visualization with interactive querying, allowing users to explore complex datasets spatially.

The application includes a main page with a heatmap renderer for visualizing population change intensity and two additional pages presenting choropleth maps of 2010 and 2020 demographic statistics, including population, median age, median household income, and percentage of occupied housing. Each demographics page supports query features that allow users to filter and analyze specific statistics dynamically. An About Us page provides links to group members’ personal pages, and a Resources page documents the data sources and tools utilized.

The web map is built using HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript leveraging the ArcGIS API for dynamic map functionality. Feature layers are hosted on ArcGIS Online and include relevant census data attributes. The workflow involved data collection, feature layer creation and hosting, HTML/CSS/JavaScript page development, and iterative testing.

The project contributes by transforming raw census data into interactive, spatially understandable visualizations, facilitating user exploration and analysis. Limitations include lack of mobile optimization and reliance on hosted layers. Future enhancements could include user-uploaded data support, improved symbology, geocoding integration, and the addition of new layers and metadata to expand analytical capabilities.
